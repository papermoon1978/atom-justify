# atom-justify package

Use this package to justify content of a column/block.

First you need a selection.

```
aaaa1 bbb
aaaa  bbb
2aa   bbb
```

Place two cursors at the outer bounds of your block (in the example above after the '1' and in front of the '2'). Then call ```createSelection``` from the menu ```atom-justify```. This will select the first block.

Now you can use 3 commands to justify the block -> ```JustifyLeft```, ```JustifyRight``` and ```Justify```. The last mentioned command will just switch between left and right.
